<h2>Hello, everyone!</h2>

Pronouns: he/him.

I'm a high school student, passionate about programming. I know a good deal of Python, I'm learning Rust, and I enjoy writing free, open-source projects for anyone. I'm also a Stack Overflow user, and I like to learn and help others learn. Aside from coding, I like doing home/car repairs, occasionally writing music, reading, driving, and figuring things out.

While also being handy, GitHub has literally _saved my (code's) life_; the [Sortery](https://github.com/SamMatzko/Sortery/) project on my computer got deleted somehow, and it was only because I had put it on GitHub that I could recover it!

Be creative, be nice, be open and welcoming, and always improve where possible. And speaking of improving, if any of you find any problems with any of my projects, let me know, or even better, submit a pull request to fix it yourself! I hope my apps come in useful and/or enjoyable!

You can see my Developer Story at https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/16775594, at least until Stack Overflow removes the Dev Story (sigh)...
