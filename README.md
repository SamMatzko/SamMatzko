# üëã Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Pronouns: he/him.

I'm a student, and I enjoy programming. I know a good deal of Python, I'm learning Rust, and I enjoy writing free, open-source projects. I'm also a [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) user (although I'm less active there now than I used to be), and I like to learn and help others learn. Aside from coding, I like doing home/car repairs, making puzzles for [Puzzling SE](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/), reading, driving, figuring things out, and occasionally writing music.

## Wanna contribute?

Most of my repos you'll find might not be active at the moment; my projects often get stalled üòè. If you want me to continue working in any of them, if you want to contribute to any of them, or if you have any suggestions for them, feel free to sumbit an issue to the repo in question, and I'll try to respond within 48 hours.
