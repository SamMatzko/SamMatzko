<h2>Hello, everyone!</h2>

Pronouns: he/him.

I'm a student, passionate about programming. I know a good deal of Python, I'm learning Rust, and I enjoy writing free, open-source projects for anyone. I'm also a Stack Overflow user, and I like to learn and help others learn. Aside from coding, I like doing home/car repairs, reading, driving, figuring things out, and occasionally writing music.

While also being handy, GitHub has literally _saved my (code's) life_; the [Sortery](https://github.com/SamMatzko/Sortery/) project on my computer got deleted somehow, and it was only because I had put it on GitHub that I could recover it!

I'm known as [Sylvester Kruin](https://stackoverflow.com/users/16775594/sylvester-kruin) on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). You can see my Developer Story at https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/16775594, at least until Stack Overflow [removes the Dev Story](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/415293/16775594) (sigh)...
