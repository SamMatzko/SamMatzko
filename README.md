<h2>Hello, everyone!</h2>

Pronouns: he/him.

I'm a student, passionate about programming. I know a good deal of Python, I'm learning Rust, and I enjoy writing free, open-source projects for anyone. I'm also a [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) user, and I like to learn and help others learn. Aside from coding, I like doing home/car repairs, reading, driving, figuring things out, and occasionally writing music.

While also being handy, GitHub has literally _saved my (code's) life_; the [Sortery](https://github.com/SamMatzko/Sortery/) project on my computer got deleted somehow, and it was only because I had put it on GitHub that I could recover it!
